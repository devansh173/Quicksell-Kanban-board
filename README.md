## ðŸ“ŒAbout Project
Develop a React-based Kanban-board app that interfaces with the provided API by Quicksell. Users gain the ability to group tickets dynamically by status, user, or priority, and sort them based on priority or title. Priority levels encompass Urgent, High, Medium, Low, and No priority, mapped to values 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0

React JS that interacts with the provided API from  https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment

When a user clicks the "display" button and selects a grouping option, the Kanban board should dynamically adjust to reflect the user's choice.

The application offers three distinct ways to group the data:

1. **By Status**: Group tickets based on their current status.
2. **By User**: Arrange tickets according to the assigned user.
3. **By Priority**: Group tickets based on their priority level.


Users is also able to sort the displayed tickets in two ways:

1. **Priority**: Arrange tickets in descending order of priority.
2. **Title**: Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.
